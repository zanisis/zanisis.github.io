###My Github First Time with MarkDown!

**About This Site:**

This is my first website from github, which I built from scratch.
I tried to apply knowledges of HTML and CSS which I gained from Hacktiv8 Coding Bootcamp online preparation class.
They call this class as Phase-0, which divided into 6 weeks. Each week consists of fundamental knowledges, which will
be useful as a foundation for the upcoming immersive on-site coding class, later on after finishing Phase-0.


**Used Tags & Syntaxes:**  
* `HTML`:  
 * Basic HTML structure : `<html>`,`<head>`, `<title>`,`<body>`
 * Header Tags : `<h1>`,`<h2>`,`<h3>`

* `CSS`:  
 * `font-family`
 * `font-size`
 * `border`
 * `margin`
 * `Etc`
